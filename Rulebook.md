## AIM OF THE GAME
---

Regicide is a cooperative game where players work together to defeat 12 powerful enemies.
Players take turns to play cards to the table to attack the enemy and once enough damage is dealt, the enemy is defeated.
The players win when the last KING is defeated. But beware! Each turn the enemy strikes back.  
Players will discard cards to satisfy the damage and if they can't discard enough, everyone loses!


---
## SETUP
---

Shuffle the four KINGs (K) and put them facedown in a pile on the table.
Shuffle the four QUEENs (Q) and put them facedown on top of the KINGs.
Shuffle the four JACKs (J) and put then facedown on top of the QUEENs.
This is the CASTLE deck.

Place the CASTLE deck in the center of the table and turn the top card face up to reveal a JACK.
This will become the current enemy.

Shuffle together all the cards numbered 2 to 10 with the four AANIMAL COMPANIONs (A) and a number of JESTERs based on the number of players (see table below) to form your TAVERN deck.

The TAVERN deck is where cards are dealt and drawn from.
During the game, place any discarded cards into a shared discard pile beside the TAVERN deck.

Deal cards to each player up to their maximum hand size.

| Players | JESTERs | Max. Hand Size |
| :-----: | :-----: | :------------: |
| 1 | 0 | 8 |
| 2 | 0 | 7 |
| 3 | 1 | 6 |
| 4 | 2 | 5 |

The player to have most recently committed regicide goes first.

## HOW TO PLAY
---

On their turn a player will play cards from their hand to deal damage to the current enemy in order to defeat it.
The values on the cards determine damage, while the suit provides a special power.  
Players may not at any time communicate to the other players what they have in their hand.  
Of course, if it's your first game or you'd rather play more casually, go ahead!

Each turn has four steps:  
- [**Step one** - Play a card or yield](#step-one)  
- [**Step two** - Activate the suit power](#step-two)  
- [**Step three** - Deal damage to the enemy and check](#step-three)  
- [**Step four** - Suffer damage from the enemy](#step-four)


### STEP ONE
**Play a card from hand to attack the enemy**

Play a card from your hand onto the table in front of you.
The number of the card determines the attack value.
So if a 7 of HEARTS is played, the attack value is seven.


### STEP TWO
**Activate the played card's suit power**

Playing a card to damage the enemy also grants a power associated with the suit of that card.
Powers from red suits (HEARTS & DIAMONDS) are resolved straight away,
 powers from black suits (CLUBS & SPADES) take effect in later steps.

##### HEARTS ♥

**Heal from the discard**: Shuffle the discard pile the count out a number of cards facedown equal to the attack value played.
Place them under the TAVERN deck (no peeking!) then, return the discard pile to the table, faceup.

##### DIAMONDS ♦

**Draw cards**: The current player draws a card. The other players follow in clockwise order drawing one card at a time
 until a number of cards equal to the attack value have been drawn.
Players that have reached their maximum hand size are skipped.
Players may never draw cards over their maximum hand size.

##### CLUBS ♣

**Double damage**: During [Step three](#step-three), damage dealt by CLUBS counts for double. The 8 of CLUBS deals sixteen damage for example.

##### SPADES ♠

**Shield against enemy attack**: During [Step four](#step-four), reduce the attack value of the current enemy by the attack value played.
The shield effect of SPADES are cumulative for all SPADES played against the current enemy by any player, and remain in effect until the enemy is defeated.


### STEP THREE
**Deal damage and check if enemy is defeated**

| Enemy | Attack | Health |
| :---: | :----: | :----: |
| JACK  | 10 | 20 |
| QUEEN | 15 | 30 |
| KING  | 20 | 40 |

Damage equal to the attack value of the played card is now dealt to the enemy.
Check to see if the total damage dealt by all players is equal to or greater than the enemy's health.
If so, do the following:

1. Discard the enemy (or place it facedown on top of the tavern deck if the players have dealt damage exactly equal to the enemy's health).
1. Discard all cards played by players against the enemy.
1. Turn the next card of the CASTLE deck face up.
1. The player who has just defeated the enemy skips [Step four](#step-four) and begins a new turn against the enemy just revealed, starting at [Step one](#step-one).


### STEP FOUR
**Suffer damage from the enemy by discarding cards**
