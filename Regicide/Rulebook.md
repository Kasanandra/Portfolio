## AIM OF THE GAME
---

Regicide is a cooperative game where players work together to defeat twelve powerful enemies.
Players take turns to play cards to the table to attack the enemy and once enough damage is dealt, the enemy is defeated.
The players win when the last KING is defeated. But beware! Each turn the enemy strikes back.  
Players will discard cards to satisfy the damage and if they can't discard enough, everyone loses!


---
## SETUP
---

Shuffle the four KINGs (K) and put them facedown in a pile on the table.
Shuffle the four QUEENs (Q) and put them facedown on top of the KINGs.
Shuffle the four JACKs (J) and put then facedown on top of the QUEENs.
This is the CASTLE deck.

Place the CASTLE deck in the center of the table and turn the top card face up to reveal a JACK.
This will become the current enemy.

Shuffle together all the cards numbered 2 to 10 with the four [ANIMAL COMPANION](#animal-companions)s (A) and a number of [JESTER](#playing-the-jester)s based on the number of players (see table below) to form your TAVERN deck.

The TAVERN deck is where cards are dealt and drawn from.
During the game, place any discarded cards into a shared discard pile beside the TAVERN deck.

Deal cards to each player up to their maximum hand size.

| Players | [JESTER](#playing-the-jester)s | Max. Hand Size |
| :-----: | :-----: | :------------: |
| 1 | 0 | 8 |
| 2 | 0 | 7 |
| 3 | 1 | 6 |
| 4 | 2 | 5 |

The player to have most recently committed regicide goes first.

## HOW TO PLAY
---

On their turn a player will play cards from their hand to deal damage to the current enemy in order to defeat it.
The values on the cards determine damage, while the suit provides a special power.  
**Players may not at any time communicate to the other players what they have in their hand.**  
Of course, if it's your first game or you'd rather play more casually, go ahead!

Each turn has four steps:  
- [**Step one** - Play a card or yield](#step-one)  
- [**Step two** - Activate the suit power](#step-two)  
- [**Step three** - Deal damage to the enemy and check](#step-three)  
- [**Step four** - Suffer damage from the enemy](#step-four)


### STEP ONE
**Play a card from hand to attack the enemy**

Play a card from your hand onto the table in front of you.
The number of the card determines the attack value.
So if a 7 of [HEARTS](#hearts- "Heal from the discard") is played, the attack value is seven.


### STEP TWO
**Activate the played card's suit power**

Playing a card to damage the enemy also grants a power associated with the suit of that card.
Powers from red suits ([HEARTS](#hearts- "Heal from the discard") & [DIAMONDS](#diamonds- "Draw cards")) are resolved straight away, powers from black suits ([CLUBS](#clubs- "Double damage") & [SPADES](#spades- "Shield against enemy attack")) take effect in later steps.

##### HEARTS ♥

**Heal from the discard**: Shuffle the discard pile the count out a number of cards facedown equal to the attack value played.
Place them under the TAVERN deck (no peeking!) then, return the discard pile to the table, faceup.

##### DIAMONDS ♦

**Draw cards**: The current player draws a card. The other players follow **in clockwise order drawing one card at a time** until a number of cards equal to the attack value have been drawn.
Players that have reached their maximum hand size are skipped.
**Players may never draw cards over their maximum hand size.**

##### CLUBS ♣

**Double damage**: During [Step three](#step-three "Deal damage and check if enemy is defeated"), damage dealt by CLUBS counts for double.
The 8 of CLUBS deals sixteen damage for example.

##### SPADES ♠

**Shield against enemy attack**: During [Step four](#step-four "Suffer damage from the enemy by discarding cards"), reduce the attack value of the current enemy by the attack value played.
The shield effect of SPADES are cumulative for all SPADES played against the current enemy by any player, and remain in effect until the enemy is defeated.


### STEP THREE
**Deal damage and check if enemy is defeated**

| Enemy | Attack | Health |
| :---: | :----: | :----: |
| JACK  | 10 | 20 |
| QUEEN | 15 | 30 |
| KING  | 20 | 40 |

Damage equal to the attack value of the played card is now dealt to the enemy.
Check to see if the total damage dealt by all players is equal to or greater than the enemy's health.
If so, do the following:

1. Discard the enemy (or place it facedown on top of the tavern deck if the players have dealt damage exactly equal to the enemy's health).
1. Discard all cards played by players against the enemy.
1. Turn the next card of the CASTLE deck face up.
1. The player who has just defeated the enemy skips [Step four](#step-four "Suffer damage from the enemy by discarding cards") and begins a new turn against the enemy just revealed, starting at [Step one](#step-one "Play a card from hand to attack the enemy").


### STEP FOUR
**Suffer damage from the enemy by discarding cards**

If not defeated, the current enemy attacks the current player by dealing damage equal to that enemy's attack value.
Remember to reduce the enemy's attack value by the total value of [SPADES](#spades- "Shield against enemy attack") that players have played against the enemy.

The current player must discard cards from their hand with a total value at least equal to the enemy's attack value.
Discard the cards one at a time, faceup to the discard pile.
It's okay to have an empty hand.
Then, the next player takes their turn, starting at [Step one](#step-one "Play a card from hand to attack the enemy").
[ANIMAL COMPANION](#animal-companions)s (A) hava a value of 1 and the [JESTER](#playing-the-jester) a value of 0 when discarded to cover damage.
If the player cannot discard enough cards to satisfy the damage, they die and all players lose the game.

---
## ENEMY IMMUNITY
---

Each enemy is immune to the suit powers of cards played against them which match their suit.
For example, players will not draw cards when a [DIAMONDS](#diamonds- "Draw cards") is played against the JACK of [DIAMONDS](#diamonds- "Draw cards") (however the number is still added to the damage total).
The [JESTER](#playing-the-jester) can be played to cancel an enemy's immunity.


---
## PLAYING THE JESTER
---

In [Step one](#step-one "Play a card from hand to attack the enemy") when playing a card the JESTER may be played (always on its own).

The JESTER has an attack value of 0.
The power of the JESTER is that it negates the immunity of the enemy meaning the suit powers of cards with the same suit as the enemy will now take effect when played.
After playing the JESTER, skip [Step three](#step-three "Deal damage and check if enemy is defeated") & [Step four](#step-four "Suffer damage from the enemy by discarding cards") then, instead of play moving to the next player, the player of the JESTER chooses any player to go next.

**Players may not discuss specific cards in their hand at any time during the game** however they can express their desire (or reluctance) to go next in a general way after the JESTER is played.
 
If the JESTER is played against a [SPADES](#spades- "Shield against enemy attack") enemy, [SPADES](#spades- "Shield against enemy attack") played prior to the JESTER will begin reducing the attack value of the enemy however [CLUBS](#clubs- "Double damage") played prior to the JESTER against a [CLUBS](#clubs- "Double damage") enemy will **not** count for double.


---
## ANIMAL COMPANIONS
---

In [Step one](#step-one "Play a card from hand to attack the enemy"), ANIMAL COMPANIONs can be played on their own, but may also be **paired with one other card** (except the [JESTER](#playing-the-jester)).
ANIMAL COMPANIONs count as 1 towards the attack total and their suit power is also applied.
For example, when playing the 8 of [DIAMONDS](#diamonds- "Draw cards") with the ANIMAL COMPANION of [CLUBS](#clubs- "Double damage") the attack value is 9 and the effect of each suit power is applied for 9: nine cards are drawn and eighteen damage is dealt.
**Any time where both a [HEARTS](#hearts- "Heal from the discard") power and a [DIAMONDS](#diamonds- "Draw cards") power are resolved together, resolve the [HEARTS](#hearts- "Heal from the discard") healing before drawing with [DIAMONDS](#diamonds- "Draw cards")**.
ANIMAL COMPANIONs can also be paired with other ANIMAL COMPANIONs.


---
## COMBOS
---

In [Step one](#step-one "Play a card from hand to attack the enemy"), instead of playing a single card, players can combine cards together in sets of two, three or four of the same number **as long as the combined total of the cards played equals ten or less**.
So players can play a pair of 2s, 3s, 4s or 5s, triple 2s and 3s, or quadruple 2s.
When these cards are played together **each suit powers is resolved at the total attack value**.
For example, if a player plays the 3 of [DIAMONDS](#diamonds- "Draw cards"), [SPADES](#spades- "Shield against enemy attack") and [CLUBS](#clubs- "Double damage") together, players will draw nine cards, reduce the enemy's attack value by nine and deal eighteen damage.


---
## DRAWING A DEFEATED ENEMY
---

A JACK in hand count as a 10, a QUEEN in hand count as a 15 and a KING in hand count as a 20.
These values are applied when either playing them as an attack card or discarding them from hand to suffer damage.
Their suit power is applied as normal when played.


---
## YIELDING
---

During [Step one](#step-one "Play a card from hand to attack the enemy") it may be more beneficial to yield instead of playing a card.
To yield simply say "Yield" and move directly to [Step four](#step-four "Suffer damage from the enemy by discarding cards"), skipping [Step two](#step-two "Activate the played card's suit power") & [Step three](#step-three "Deal damage and check if enemy is defeated").
**All players are not allowed to yield consecutively**.


---
## GAME END
---

The game ends when the players win by defeating the last KING or when the players lose because a player is unable to satisfy the damage dealt by an enemy.


---
## SOLO PLAY
---

When playing with only one player note the following rule changes:

Set up the game as a per usual but place the two [JESTER](#playing-the-jester)s to the side.
You play with a single hand limited to eight cards.
Play as normal, playing each turn one after the other. A [JESTER](#playing-the-jester) can be flipped to activate the following power: "*Discard your hand and refill to eight cards - this does not count as drawing for the purposes of enemy [DIAMOND](#diamonds- "Draw cards") immunity.*"
Since you have two [JESTER](#playing-the-jester)s this can be done twice per game.
Flipping the [JESTER](#playing-the-jester)s in this way does not cancel enemy immunity.
You are allowed to use the [JESTER](#playing-the-jester) power:
 a) at the start of [Step one](#step-one "Play a card from hand to attack the enemy") before you play a card
 b) at the start of [Step four](#step-four "Suffer damage from the enemy by discarding cards") before you have to take damage
 
A win having used two [JESTER](#playing-the-jester)s = Bronze Victory  
A win having used one [JESTER](#playing-the-jester)  = Silver Victory  
A win having used no  [JESTER](#playing-the-jester)s = Gold Victory
